# PNEUMONIA Detection
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. It kills more children younger than 5 years old each year than any other infectious disease, such as HIV infection, malaria, or tuberculosis. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays may help confirm the diagnosis.

his dataset contains 5,856 validated Chest X-Ray images. The images are split into a training set and a testing set of independent patients. Images are labeled as (disease:NORMAL/BACTERIA/VIRUS)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number of a patient). For details of the data collection and description, see the referenced paper below.

According to the paper, the images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou.
